# Steps of Digestion
- First you chew the food in your mouth which breaks it down and the salivary glands release **amylase** to digest starch
- Food passes down oesophagus into the stomach
- In the stomach enzymes begin the digestion of proteins. The stomach also contains HCl which helps the enzymes digest the proteins. The food spends several hours in the stomach. The **churning** action of the stomach muscles turns the food into a fluid increasing surface area for enzymes
- The fluid passes into the small intestine and chemicals are released into the small intestine from the liver and pancreas.
- The pancreas releases enzymes that continue the digestion of starch and protein, they also start the digestion of lipids.
- The liver releases **bile** which helps speed up digestion of lipids and also neutralises stomach acid
- The walls of the small intestine release enzymes to continue the digestion of protein and lipids  
- In the small intestine the small food molecules produced by digestion are absorbed into the blood stream by **active transport** or **diffusion** 
- Now the fluid makes its way through the large intestine where water is absorbed into the bloodstream
- Then waste products are released from the body

**The products of digestion are then used by the body to build new carbohydrates, lipids and proteins**
**Some glucose produced is used in respiration**
