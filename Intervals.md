# Definition
An interval is a subset of [[The Real Numbers]] that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the subset.

# Endpoints
The endpoints of an interval are its **supremum**, and its **infimum**, if they exist as real numbers. If the *infimum does not exist*, one says often that the corresponding endpoint is $\infty$ Similarly, if the *supremum does not exist*, one says that the corresponding endpoint is $-\infty$

# Types of Intervals
An **open interval** does not include any endpoint, and is indicated with parentheses, Whereas a **closed interval** is an interval that includes all its endpoints and is denoted with square brackets. A **half-open interval** has two endpoints and includes only one of them. It is said left-open or right-open depending on whether the excluded endpoint is on the left or on the right

# Notation
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Open Intervals} \\
(a,b) & =\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid a<x<b\} \\
(-\infty,b) & =\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x<b\} \\
(a,+\infty) & =\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid a<x\} \\
(-\infty,+\infty) &= \mathbb{R} \\
\text{Closed Interval} \\
[a, b]&= \{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid a\leq x \leq b\} \\
\text{Half Intervals} \\
(a,b] &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}| a < x \leq b\} \\
[a,b) &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}| a \leq x < b\} \\
[a,+\infty) &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}| a \leq x\} \\
(-\infty,b] &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}| x \leq b\}
\end{aligned}$$
