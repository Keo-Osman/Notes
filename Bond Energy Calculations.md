- If the reaction is **exothermic** energy is transferred to the surroundings so the net energy change is **negative**
- If the reaction is **endothermic** energy is transferred to the surroundings so the net energy change is **positive**
Breaking bonds requires energy and is endothermic. Whereas, making bonds releases energy and is exothermic.
**Net energy change = Energy to break bonds - Energy released making bonds**.
