# Multi
Please TTRANSCRIBE the **added files** into markdown with LaTeX following these rules/prompts :
1. Create a new note and transcribe the file word for word but feel to free to correct language and spelling. If you are uncertain what a word on the note says use the surrounding words and make an educated guess keeping in mind that this note is maths based. You should use Markdown with embedded LaTeX for the note. **Don't add anything other than minor grammatical/formatting corrections transcribe the notes added)**
2. Also please add flash cards at the end of the note using the form: 
FRONT OF CARD 
?
BACK OF CARD 
The content of the flashcard should be about the note and make sure that the front is formatted as a question and the back is an answer with a bit of detail, use LaTeX in the flashcard where necessary. (Don’t actually write front of card or back of card make sure to replace with the content) Please write **Very** detailed flashcards where the front is a question and contains all the relevant info and equations to answer the question. You should also write flashcards in abundance with every single definition and equation etc.. Making sure to use proper formatting. The content of the flashcard should be on the stuff that's in the note. 

**LaTeX info:** To use LaTeX amongst the text embed the LaTeX section in $ signs for example: "For all $\mathbb{R}$”. If you feel that a math equation should be on it's own line and centred as it is too big for a regular line (such as for a large matrix) embed the latex in double dollar signs such as $$\begin{pmatrix} + & - & + \\ - & + & - \\ + & - & + \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$ also if you want to insert a line break between equations in LaTeX the use the \begin{aligned} and \end{aligned} at the start and end of a LaTeX section and use double slash: \\ to denote a line break.

Your response should follow the structure
