## Paper 1

### B1 - Cell Biology
- [[Cells]]
- [[Biological Transportation]]
**Summary**
Covers cell structure (prokaryotic and eukaryotic), microscopy, cell division (mitosis), and stem cells. Focus on cellular functions and their importance in growth, repair, and technology like stem cell therapy
### B2 - Organisation
- [[Cell Division]]

- [[Digestive Enzymes]]
- [[Digestive Enzymes]]
- [[Transpiration and Translocation]]
- [[Plant Tissue]]
- [[Breathing System]]
**Summary**
Explores the human digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems. Includes enzymes, blood composition, and plant systems (transpiration, translocation). Links structure to function and health to lifestyle​
### B3 - Infection and Response

- [[Diseases in Plants]]
- [[Monoclonal Antibodies]]
- [[Non Specific Defence Systems in Humans]]
- [[Pathogens]]
- [[Plant Defence System]]
- [[The Immune System]]
- [[Vaccination]]
**Summary**
Pathogens and disease, the immune system, vaccination, antibiotics, and drug development. Includes the global importance of fighting communicable diseases​
### B4 - Bioenergetics
**Summary**
Photosynthesis and respiration (aerobic and anaerobic). Focus on energy transfer in plants and animals and the response of the body to exercise

## Paper 2
### B5 - Homeostasis and Response
- [[Reactions and Reflexes]]
**Summary**
Regulation of internal conditions, nervous and hormonal systems, the role of the brain, and human reproductive processes. Includes reflex actions and feedback systems​
### B6 - Inheritance, Variation and Evolution
**Summary**
Genetics, inheritance patterns, evolution, and the impact of modern biology like cloning and genetic modification. Includes natural selection and biodiversity​
