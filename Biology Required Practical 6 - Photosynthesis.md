# Method
- First place a test tube 10cm away from and LED lamp
- Then fill the test tube with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution *(which releases carbon dioxide)*
- Put a piece of pondweed into the boiling tube with the cut end at the top
- Leave 5 minutes to acclimatise 
- Start a stopwatch and count the number of oxygen bubbles produced in one minute
- Repeat and take a mean
- Do the whole experiment with varying distances of the test tube from the lamp
**For more accurate method:**
- Use an upside funnel over the pondweed, which goes into a measuring cylinder to measure volume of oxygen produced

**Rate of photo synthesis is inversely proportional to distance$^2$ - this is called Inverse square law**

How do you investigate the effect of light intensity on photosynthesis?
?
- First place a test tube 10cm away from and LED lamp
- Then fill the test tube with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution *(which releases carbon dioxide)*
- Put a piece of pondweed into the boiling tube with the cut end at the top
- Leave 5 minutes to acclimatise 
- Start a stopwatch and count the number of oxygen bubbles produced in one minute
- Repeat and take a mean
- Do the whole experiment with varying distances of the test tube from the lamp
**For more accurate method:**
- Use an upside funnel over the pondweed, which goes into a measuring cylinder to measure volume of oxygen produced 

How do rate of photosynthesis and distance relate?
?
**Rate of photo synthesis is inversely proportional to distance$^2$ - this is called Inverse square law
