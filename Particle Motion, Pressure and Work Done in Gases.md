# Particle Motion in Gases
- The particles are very far apart moving in random directions

# Pressure in Gases
The pressure of a gas is due to particles colliding with the walls of the container that the gas is held in in this collision the gas particles apply a force at right angles to the walls of the container we say the particles are **exerting a pressure** 
- Pressure can be increased by increasing frequency of collisions or energy of each collision
- Increasing temperature means the particles have a higher average kinetic energy so there are more frequent collisions with higher energy

# Work Done on a Gas
- If you compress the gas by applying a force you have now done work on the gas so energy has been transferred to the gas particles so the internal energy of the gas is increased so the gas temperature is increased so the pressure is increased
