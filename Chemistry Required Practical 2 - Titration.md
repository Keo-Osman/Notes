# Method
-  Use a pipette to transfer 25cm$^3$ of **alkali** solution into a conical flask
- Add 5 drops of methyl orange to the conical flask
- Place conical flask on white tile
- Fill a **Burette** with **Acid**
- Add acid to alkali slowly and once you see a colour add drop by drop until the solution is neutral making sure to swirl solution to mix. *Methyl orange colour change will be yellow to red*
- Read volume of acid from burette making sure your eye is level and read from the bottom of the meniscus
- Repeat until 2 readings are within 0.1cm$^3$ and take a mean
- Now calculate concentration of acid
