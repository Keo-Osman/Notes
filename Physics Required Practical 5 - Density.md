# Method
**For irregular objects**
- First measure th mass of the object with a balance
- Fill a eureka can with water up to the spout
- Place a measuring cylinder under the spout
- Slowly lower the object into the eureka can - this will displace water equal to it's volume which will enter the measuring cylinder
- Once it's fully submerged read the volume and calculate density
