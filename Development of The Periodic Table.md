# Modern Periodic
- Ordered by atomic number
- Arranged in columns called groups (1-8/0) with a block of transition metals in between. Elements in groups share similar properties and have same number of electrons in outer shell  
- Arranged in periods 
# Mendeleev's Table
- Arranged in increasing atomic weight - this could go wrong due to isotopes
- Switched order of specific elements to fit patterns - this was due to isotopes as well
- Realised some elements hadn't been discovered so he left gaps
- Predicted properties of these based on properties of the groups
- These later matched observations so it was accepted
- Group 0 had not been discovered
# Early Periodic Table
 - Arranged in increasing atomic weight
 - Every 8th element react in similar ways - *Law of octaves*
 - However always sticking to this law meant that some metals were grouped together that shouldn't be
