# Method
- First pour 50cm$^3$ of solution into a beaker
- Then place plastic petri dish with two holes over beaker
- Insert an inert graphite electrode into each hole - *They must not touch*
- Attach crocodile leads to the electrodes and connect to a low voltage DC power supply in a series circuit
# Observations and Results
## Molten
- The cation *(the positive metal ion)* will move to the cathode *(the negative electrode)* where it is reduced *(gains electrons)* and forms atoms. 
- The anion (*negative non-metal ion)* will move to the anode *(the positive electrode)* where it is oxidised *(loses electrons)* to form atoms. 
- *For elements that are only found in diatomic form, the ions will bond covalently.* 
- *Also oxygen will react with the graphite electrodes so they will need to be replaced*

## Aqueous Solutions
- Aqueous solutions are dissolved in water. Water molecules ionise forming $OH^-$ and $H^+$
- **At the cathode:** hydrogen is produced **IF** the metal is **MORE** reactive than hydrogen otherwise the metal is produced
- **At the anode:** if the aqueous solution contains halide ions then the halogen will be produce at the anode otherwise oxygen is produced

# Extraction
Metals that are more reactive than carbon are extracted by electrolysis

# Half Equations
Half equations show what happens at the electrodes in terms of gaining/losing electrons.
For metal ions *(M$^{n+}$)*:
$$M^{n+}+ne^-\rightarrow M$$
For non-metal ions *(M$^{n-}$)*:
$$M^{n-}\rightarrow M + ne^-$$
For $OH^-$ ions *(oxidation reaction at **anode**)*: $$4OH^- \rightarrow O_2+2H_2O \space +4e^-$$

What is observed in electrolyis is both molten and aqeuos solutions?
?
- **Molten**
	- The cation *(the positive metal ion)* will move to the cathode *(the negative electrode)* where it is reduced *(gains electrons)* and forms atoms. 
	- The anion (*negative non-metal ion)* will move to the anode *(the positive electrode)* where it is oxidised *(loses electrons)* to form atoms. 
	- *For elements that are only found in diatomic form, the ions will bond covalently.* 
	- *Also oxygen will react with the graphite electrodes so they will need to be replaced*

What are the half equations for electrolysis?
?
Half equations show what happens at the electrodes in terms of gaining/losing electrons.
For metal ions *(M$^{n+}$)*:
$$M^{n+}+ne^-\rightarrow M$$
For non-metal ions *(M$^{n-}$)*:
$$M^{n-}\rightarrow M + ne^-$$
For $OH^-$ ions *(oxidation reaction at **anode**)*: $$4OH^- \rightarrow O_2+2H_2O \space +4e^-$$
