# Cells
When 2 different metals are placed in an **electrolyte** then we can produce electricity. (*An electrolyte is a solution that can conduct electricity)*. This is because they create a potential difference between them. And they react with the electrolyte and the spare electrons from the reaction flow from high to low potential *(A bit like in electrolysis)*
- A cell can only produce electricity for a certain period of time before the chemicals in the cell run out and the reaction stops.
- They only produce electricity is we use metals with different reactivities - the size of potential difference depends on the difference in reactivity
- The electrolyte also effects potential difference
# Battery
A battery is two or more cells connected **in series** to produce a grater voltage

# Rechargeable Cells and Batteries
- **Alkaline** batteries are none rechargeable as the reactants eventually run out. The reaction can't be reversed so they are non rechargeable
- **Rechargeable** batteries can be recharged as the chemical reaction can be reversed when an electrical current is supplied

# Hydrogen Fuel Cells
- A fuel (hydrogen) is reacted with oxygen, this chemical reaction produces an electric current.
- The only waste product is water
- Hydrogen is being oxidised
- Overall equation $2H_2+O_2\rightarrow2H_2O$
## Half Equations
At the negative electrode: $2H_2 \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^-$
At the positive electrode: $O_2 + 4H^++4e^- \rightarrow 2H_2O$
## Advantages
- Produce electricity as long as hydrogen is provided
- Do not get less efficient over time
- Can be a source of drink water
## Disadvantages
- Hydrogen is explosive and difficult to store
- Low potential difference
