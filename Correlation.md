# Correlation
- Correlation describes the nature of the linear relationship between 2 variables in some given bivariate data
- 2 variables have a causal relationship if one affects the other - This is NOT guaranteed even if the two are correlated

# Linear Regression
The regression line of $y$ on $x$ is $y = a + bx$ You should only use the regression line to predict values within the range of the given data
