The job of the non-specific defence system is to prevent pathogens from entering the body
# Skin
- Forms a protective layer covering the body
- Outer layer consist of dead cells - difficult to penetrate
- Produces an oily substance called sebum which can kill bacteria
# Nose
- Contains hair and mucus to trap pathogens
# Lungs
- Trachea and bronchi are covered with tiny hairs called cilia covered in mucus to trap pathogens
- Wafts mucus up throat to go into stomach
# Stomach
- Contains HCl to kill pathogens
