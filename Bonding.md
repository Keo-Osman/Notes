# Ionic
Ionic bonds is when a non-metal reacts with a metal. Electrons are transferred from the metal to the non-metal, to complete both outer shells, forming positive metal ions and negative non-metal ions which are held together by a strong force of electrostatic attraction in a giant lattice. *The greater the charge of the ions, the higher its melting/boiling point*
## Melting/Boiling
They have **high** melting/boiling points due to strong ionic bonds and giant lattice structure.
When a substance consisting of ionic bonds is melted the electrostatic force of attraction between the ions is overcome and the ions are free to move
## Electrical Conductivity
When solid they can't conduct as the ions are held in place buy electrostatic forces but when they are molten or aqueous the ions are free to move carrying a charge therefore conducting electricity.
# Covalent
## Simple
Simple Covalent bonds is when two non-metals react. The atoms share pairs of electrons to complete their outer shells. The bonds are strong and require lots of energy to overcome but they are held together by weak intermolecular forces
### Melting/Boiling
They have low melting/boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces.
When a substance consisting of simple covalent bonds is melted the intermolecular forces between molecules is overcome and the molecules are free to move but the atoms in the molecules are still bonded together
### Electrical Conductivity
Can't conduct electricity as they have no free electrons or ions
## Giant
Giant covalent structures contain tons of atoms each joined to the adjacent atom by a covalent bond arranged in giant structures often regular lattices.
### Melting/Boiling
They have **high** melting and boiling points due to the large number of strong covalent bonds
### Electrical Conductivity
Some giant covalent structures can conduct electricity such as graphite due to delocalised electrons that are free to move through the structure. But others like diamond can't
# Metallic
Metallic bonding is the attraction between the positive metal ions in a regular lattice consisting of layers and the delocalised electrons which are free to move through the structure. *The greater the number of outer electrons that the metal has, the higher its melting/boiling point*
## Melting/Boiling
Metallic bonds are strong, so metals can maintain a **regular structure** and usually have **high melting and boiling points**.
## Electrical Conductivity
They can conduct electricity due to delocalised electrons that are free to move through the structure. *The higher the charge of the metal ion the greater conductivity due to a higher number of delocalised electrons*
