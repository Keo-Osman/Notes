## Introduction

Instruction sets are fundamental components of computer architecture that define the set of operations a processor can perform. These sets play a crucial role in determining the capabilities and efficiency of a CPU in executing various tasks.

## SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)

SIMD is a parallel computing technique that enables a single instruction to operate on multiple data points simultaneously. This approach significantly enhances computational efficiency for tasks involving data-level parallelism.

### SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)

SSE is a widely-used SIMD instruction set extension introduced by Intel in the late 1990s. It provides a set of instructions for performing operations on multiple data elements in parallel, improving performance for multimedia and scientific applications.

### AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)

AVX is a more recent extension to the x86 instruction set architecture, introduced by Intel with Sandy Bridge processors. It further enhances SIMD capabilities by widening vector registers and introducing new instructions for improved performance.

### AVX-512

AVX-512 is an extension of AVX introduced with Intel's Xeon Phi processors and later adopted in their Xeon Scalable and Core X-series processors. It extends vector register width to 512 bits and introduces new instructions to accelerate performance for demanding computational tasks.
