# Diffusion
**Diffusion is the movement/spreading out of particles from areas of high to low concentration**.
- Goes with concentration gradient
- No energy is required
- **Factors**
	- Temperature
	- Surface area
**Example to learn:**
- Fish have gills which are covered in large numbers of fine filaments where gas pass in and out of blood
- Filaments are adapted as they
	- Have massive surface area
	- This membrane for short diffusion path
	- Efficient blood supply to ensure **Concentration Gradient** is high
# Osmosis
**Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution through a partially permeable membrane**
- Goes against concentration gradient 
- Cytoplasm is a relatively concentrated solution so it has low concentration of water so water moves into cell by osmosis
# Active Transport
**Active transport moves substances from a more dilute solution to a more concentrated solution**
- Against concentration gradient
- Requires energy *(from respiration)*
