$$\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c$$

Trigonometric identities can be used to integrate expressions. This allows an expression that cannot be integrated to be replaced by an identical expression that can be integrated.

To integrate expressions of the form $\int k \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} dx$, try $\ln|f(x)|$ and differentiate to check, and then adjust any constant.

To integrate an expression of the form $\int kf'(x)(f(x))^n dx$, try $(f(x))^{n+1}$ and differentiate to check, and then adjust any constant.

Sometimes you can simplify an integral by changing the variable. This process is similar to using the chain rule in differentiation and is called integration by substitution.

The integration by parts formula is given by: $\int u \frac{dv}{dx} dx = uv - \int v \frac{du}{dx} dx$

Partial fractions can be used to integrate algebraic fractions.

The area bounded by two curves can be found using integration:
   Area of $R = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) dx = \int_a^b f(x) dx - \int_a^b g(x) dx$

The trapezium rule is:
    $$\int_a^b y dx \approx \frac{1}{2}h(y_0 + 2(y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_{n-1}) + y_n)$$
    where $h = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $y_i = f(a + ih)$.

When $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$ you can write
    $$\int \frac{1}{g(y)} dy = \int f(x) dx$$

## Improper integrals

The integral $\int_a^b f(x)dx$ is improper if:
- One or both of the limits are $\pm \infty$ or
- $f(x)$ is undefined at any point in $[a,b]$

An improper integral exists if it is convergent.

To find $\int_a^\infty f(x)dx$, consider $\int_a^t f(x)dx$ and compute the limit (if it converges) as $t \to \infty$

For an integral $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx$, split into 2 integrals: $\int_{-\infty}^c f(x)dx + \int_c^{\infty} f(x)dx$ , $c \in \mathbb{R}$

## Mean Value

The mean value of a function $f(x)$ in the interval $[a,b]$ is:

$$\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)dx$$

This is because the integral is taking infinite samples.

If $f(x)$ has mean value $\bar{f}$ over the interval $[a,b]$ then:
- $f(x) + k$ has mean value $\bar{f} + k$
- $kf(x)$ has mean value $k\bar{f}$, $k \in \mathbb{R}$

## Reduction Formula

The Reduction formula allows you to write an integral as a recurrence relation. This is generally used for integrals with high powers that would require many **integration by parts** iterations.

$$J_n = \int g(x,n)dx = \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} g_r(n)I_r$$

$$\int (g(x))^n g'(x) dx = \frac{1}{n+1} g(x)^{n+1}$$

You can use the reduction formula in conjunction with a substitution $r = g(x)$ and the Method of Differences to compute tricky summations.

## Arc Length

The arc length of $y = g(x)$ from $A(x_A, y_A)$ and $B(x_B, y_B)$ is:

$$s = \int_{x_A}^{x_B} \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} dx \quad \text{or} \quad s = \int_{y_A}^{y_B} \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dx}{dy}\right)^2} dy$$

If the equations are parametric, $x = g(t)$, $y = g(t)$, then the arc length from $A(g(t_A), g(t_A))$ to $B(g(t_B), g(t_B))$ is:

$$s = \int_{t_A}^{t_B} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} dt$$

If the equation is given in polar form $r = g(\theta)$, then the arc length from half lines $\theta = \alpha$ to $\theta = \beta$ is:

$$s = \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{r^2 + \left(\frac{dr}{d\theta}\right)^2} d\theta$$


## Surface Area of Volume of Revolution
The area, $S$, of the surface generated when the arc $A B$ on the curve $C$ is rotated completely about the $x$-axis is $2 \pi \int y \mathrm{ds}$, and about the $y$-axis is $2 \pi \int x \mathrm{ds}$.
These can be used to give the following results:
- About the $x$-axis: $$S=2 \pi \int_{x_A}^{x_x} y \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} x$$
- About the $y$-axis: $$S=2 \pi \int_{y_A}^{y_s} x \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} y}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} y \quad \text{or} \quad S=2 \pi \int_{x_A}^{x_s} x \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} x$$
If $C$ is given in parametric form, the results are
- About the $x$-axis: $$S=2 \pi \int_{t_A}^{t_s} y \sqrt{\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} t}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} t}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} t$$
- About the $y$-axis: $$S=2 \pi \int_{t_A}^{t_s x} \sqrt{\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} t}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} t}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} t$$
If $C$ is given in polar form, the results are
- About the initial line $\theta = 0$  $$S=2 \pi \int_\alpha^3 r \sin \theta \sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d} r}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} \theta$$
- About the line $\theta= \pm \frac{\pi}{2}:$ $$ S=2 \pi \int_\alpha^\beta r \cos \theta \sqrt{r^2+\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} \theta}{\mathrm{d} r}\right)^2} \mathrm{~d} \theta$$
