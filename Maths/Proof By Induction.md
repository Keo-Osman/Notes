Proof by induction is a way to prove that a general statement holds for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (can be used for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ but this is less common)
-  First prove the general statement for any n (generally n = 0, 1
- Next assume that the statement is true for n = k
- Show that if the statement is true for n = k it follows that itâ€™s true for n = k+1 (ie prove for all n $\in \mathbb{Z}$)
- Conclude that the statement is true for all n $\in \mathbb{N}$ (or for all n $\in \mathbb{Z}$)

*This last step works as after the base case you show that the next number holds, then this becomes a base case and you can keep going to prove for all n*
