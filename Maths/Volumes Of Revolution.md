## Volume of Revolution
In regular integration of a function $f(x)$ you obtain the area under by considering smaller rectangles with height and width $dx$ so the approximate area is $\sum f(x)dx$ as $dx \rightarrow 0$ this is written as $\int f(x)dx$

For a Volume of Revolution you do the same however the areas are small cylindrical volumes. These volume is $\pi r^2h$ in this case $f(x)$ is the radius and we consider $h$ (the width in the case) going to zero so the approximate area $\sum f(x)^2\pi dx$ as $dx \rightarrow 0$. The exact volume is written as $\pi \int f(x)^2dx$. You must make sure that the curve has been rotated around a the x axis exactly $2\pi$ radians.

You can do the same thing for a volume of revolution around the y axis by rearranging to get $x = f(y)$ then the volume will be $\pi \int f(y)^2dy$. Keep in mind that a and b are values of y and that the radius of the volume is from the y axis going across parallel to the x axis until the curve.

## Volume of Parametric Revolution
For a parametric equation defined $y = g(t), x = f(t)$ you can find the volumes of revolution with the following formulae:

**About the y axis** $$\pi \int_{t=q}^{t=p} f(t)^2 \frac{dx}{dt} dt$$

**About the x axis** $$\pi \int_{t=q}^{t=p} g(t)^2 \frac{dy}{dt} dt$$
