## Polar Coordinates & Equations

The coordinates of P can be written in Cartesian form as $(x,y)$ but can be written as $(r,\theta)$ in polar form where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle of rotation from the positive X-axis.

To convert from polar to Cartesian you can use the following:

- $r \cos\theta = x$
- $r \sin\theta = y$
- $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$
- $\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$



Polar equations are usually given in the form $r = f(\theta)$ so as $\theta$ varies from 0 to $2\pi$ points are placed around the whole graph varying distance.

## Sketching curves

Common curves are: 
- $r = a$, a circle with centre origin radius $a$ 
- $\theta = \alpha$, a half line making angle $\alpha$ 
- $r = a\theta$, a spiral starting at origin
- $r = a(1 + q \cos\theta)$, They are called ***Cardioids*** (are given in the form $r = a(1 + q \cos\theta)$. They are defined for all $\theta$ if $p > q$)

Cardioids fall into 2 categories "egg" shaped and those with a "dimple", egg shaped are convex curves, dimples are concave at $\theta = \pi$

They are egg shaped when $p > 2q$ and dimple shaped if $q < p < 2q$.


## Area enclosed by a Polar Curve

The area enclosed by a polar curve and half lines $\theta = \alpha, \theta = \beta$ where $\theta$ is measured in radians is given as:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} r^2 d\theta$$

## Tangent to polar Curve:

You can differentiate parametrically to get:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}$$

To find a tangent line to the parallel to the initial set:

$$\frac{dy}{d\theta} = 0$$

To find a tangent perpendicular to the initial line set:

$$\frac{dx}{d\theta} = 0$$

What are polar coordinates?
?
Polar coordinates represent a point $P$ as $(r,\theta)$, where $r$ is the distance from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle of rotation from the positive X-axis. 

How do you convert from polar to Cartesian coordinates?
?
Use these equations:
- $x = r \cos \theta$
- $y = r \sin \theta$
- $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$
- $\theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$ 

What is the general form of a polar equation?
?
Polar equations are usually given in the form $r = f(\theta)$. 

What polar equation represents a circle with centre at the origin?
?
$r = a$, where $a$ is the radius of the circle. 

What polar equation represents a half-line?
?
$\theta = \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle the line makes with the positive X-axis. 

What polar equation represents a spiral starting at the origin?
?
$r = a\theta$, where $a$ is a constant. 

What is the general form of a cardioid in polar coordinates?
?
$r = a(p + q \cos \theta)$, where $a$ and $q$ are constants, $q \leq p$. 

When is a cardioid "egg-shaped" and when does it have a "dimple"?
?
Egg-shaped (convex): when $p > 2q$
Dimple (concave at $\theta = \pi$): when $q < p < 2q$ 

What is the formula for the area enclosed by a polar curve between $\theta = \alpha$ and $\theta = \beta$?
?
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} r^2 d\theta$$ 

How do you find the slope of a tangent line to a polar curve?
?
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{d\theta}}{\frac{dx}{d\theta}}$$ 

How do you find a tangent line parallel to the initial line?
?
Set $$\frac{dy}{d\theta} = 0$$ 

How do you find a tangent line perpendicular to the initial line?
?
Set $$\frac{dx}{d\theta} = 0$$
