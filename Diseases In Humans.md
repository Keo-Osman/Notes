# Specific Diseases
### 1. **HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)**
- **Type of pathogen**: **Virus**
- **Symptoms**: Early stages include flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, fatigue). As the infection progresses, symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) appear, such as weight loss, persistent infections, night sweats, and fatigue.
- **Treatment**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the virus, helping individuals live longer and healthier lives, but there is no cure.
- **How it spreads**: Through bodily fluids, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk, and during childbirth or breastfeeding. The most common transmission routes are unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, and from mother to child during childbirth
### 2. **Measles**
- **Type of pathogen**: **Virus** (Measles virus)
- **Symptoms**: High fever, cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, and a red rash that usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. It can lead to complications like pneumonia and encephalitis.
- **Treatment**: There is no specific antiviral treatment, but supportive care (hydration, fever management) helps. Vitamin A supplements and managing complications are also important. Measles is preventable through the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.
- **How it spreads**: Highly contagious, it spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. The virus can remain in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours.

### 3. **Salmonella**
- **Type of pathogen**: **Bacteria** (Salmonella spp.)
- **Symptoms**: Diarrhoea, stomach cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes headache. Symptoms usually last 4-7 days.
- **Treatment**: Most cases resolve without treatment other than rehydration, but severe cases may require antibiotics.
- **How it spreads**: Through contaminated food or water, especially undercooked poultry, eggs, and unwashed fruits or vegetables. It can also spread through contact with infected animals or their environments.
### 4. **Gonorrhoea**
- **Type of pathogen**: **Bacteria** (Neisseria gonorrhoeae)
- **Symptoms**: In men, symptoms include painful urination and pus-like discharge from the penis. In women, symptoms may include increased vaginal discharge, painful urination, and bleeding between periods. Some cases are asymptomatic.
- **Treatment**: Treated with antibiotics, though antibiotic-resistant strains are emerging, making treatment more challenging.
- **How it spreads**: Through unprotected sexual contact (vaginal, oral, or anal) with an infected person.
### 5. **Malaria**
- **Type of pathogen**: **Protist (Parasite)** (Plasmodium spp.)
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, sweats, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain. Severe cases can lead to organ failure, coma, and death if untreated.
- **Treatment**: Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and other medications depending on the strain and resistance. Prevention includes using mosquito nets and repellents, and taking prophylactic antimalarials in high-risk areas.
- **How it spreads**: Through the bite of infected **female Anopheles mosquitoes**, which transfer the Plasmodium parasite.

**Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)**
?
- **Type of pathogen**: **Virus**
- **Symptoms**: Affects tobacco and other plants, causing mosaic-like patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, stunted growth, and reduced crop yield.
- **Treatment**: There is no cure for infected plants. Prevention involves planting resistant strains and maintaining proper hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and removing infected plants.
- **How it spreads**: The virus spreads through direct contact between infected plants, contaminated tools, hands, or soil.

**Salmonella**
?
- **Type of pathogen**: **Bacteria** (Salmonella spp.)
- **Symptoms**: Diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes headache. Symptoms usually last 4-7 days.
