# Method
- First tape a wire to a metre ruler
- Then set up a series circuit with a switch, the wire connected by crocodile clips at 0cm and 1m with a voltmeter across it and an ammeter
- The record the potential difference and current and calculate resistance
- Then repeat making the wire shorter turning the circuit of in between to allow the wire to cool
- **Zero Error**
	- A zero error is a reading on a measuring instrument when the value should be zero. You need to subtract the zero error from the result
