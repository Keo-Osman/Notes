# Eukaryote vs Prokaryote
## Eukaryote
**A Eukaryote is a cell that contains their genetic material ([[DNA]]) in the nucleus**.
Both **Animal** and **Plant** cells are Eukaryotes
### Features
##### Animal Cell
- Cell membrane
- Cytoplasm
- Nucleus
- Ribosome
- Mitochondria
## Prokaryote
**A Prokaryote is a cell where the genetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus**
 - Their genetic material consists of one loop of [[DNA]] 
 - The might also have small rings of [[DNA]] called **Plasmids**
### Features
- DNA loop
- Plasmids
- Cytoplasm
- Cell Wall
- Cell Membrane

## Differences
- Prokaryotes are much smaller
- Prokaryotes have no nucleus

# Cell Specialisation
## Animal
**Most animal cells are specialised** which means they have adaptations which help them carry out a particular function when cells become specialised it's called differentiation
### Sperm Cell
- Only contain half of genetic information
- Long tail to swim and are streamlined
- Packed with mitochondria for energy to swim
- Contain enzymes to digest their way through outer layer of ovum
### Nerve Cell
- Their job is to send electrical impulse around body
- They have axon to carry impulses
- Axon covered with myelin to insulate and speed up transfer of impulse
- have synapse to allow impulse to pass to one nerve to next
- dendrites to increase surface area so other nerves connect easier
### Muscle Cell
- Can contract they contain protein fibres to do this
- Packed full of mitochondria to provide energy for contraction
- Work together to form muscle tissue

## Plant
### Xylem
- Found in plant stem
- Form long tubes to carry water dissolve minerals from roots to leaves
- Very thick walls containing lignin to support plant, causes xylem cells to die
- *End* walls between cells broken to form a tube
- No nucleus, cytoplasm, vacuole chloroplasts
### Phloem
- Carry dissolved sugars up and down plant
- Consists of phloem vessel cells, no nucleus with limited cytoplasm. And the end walls of these have pores called sieve plates, these feature allow dissolved sugars to move through 
- Each vessel cell has a companion cell with lots of mitochondria for energy for active transport
### Root hair cell
- Hairs on roots to increase surface area
- Do not contain chloroplasts
- Use [[Biological Transportation#Flashcards/Flashcards/Active Transport| Active Transport]] to absorb ions from the soil
# Stem Cells
A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell and is capable of differentiating into other types of cells.
- **Human/Animal**
	- **Embryonic stem cells** - found in embryo and can differentiate into any body cell
	- **Adult stem cells** - found in bone marrow and differentiates to form cells in [[Circulatory System#Flashcards/Flashcards/Blood|blood]] 
- **Plant**
	- Meristem tissue *(found in roots and buds)* can differentiate into any cell at any point can be used to produced clones
