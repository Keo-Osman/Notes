## Reflex
**A reflex action is a protective, automatic and rapid response to a stimulus**
It follows the same general sequence as a normal reaction but circumvents the brain as to be faster.
The **Reflex Arc** is: stimulus -> receptor -> sensory neurone -> relay neurone -> motor neurone -> effector -> response
