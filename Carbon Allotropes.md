# Graphene
It is a single layer of graphene.
Properties:
- Good conductor of electricity - delocalised electros
- Strong with high melting point - lots of strong covalent bonds
# Fullerene
- Have hollow shapes
- Have rings of 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms
## Buckminsterfullerene $C_{60}$
- Arranged in sphere
- Carbon forms rings of 5 or 6 carbon atoms
- Uses
	- Can deliver drugs
	- Lubricants in machines
	- Catalysts
## Carbon nanotubes
- High length : diameter ration
- Rings of 6 carbon atoms
- Properties
	- High tensile strength
	- Delocalised electrons for conduction of electricity
