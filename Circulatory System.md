# The Heart
*Diagram Left/Right are flipped because its as if you are looking though at somebody else's heart*
![[Heart-Diagram.png]]
*Most of the heart Is self explanatory or simply explained by the diagram so no extra info is needed*

# Blood
Blood is the transport medium of gas and nutrients it contains 4 major substances
## Red Blood Cells
Transport oxygen after absorbing it from lungs. Their **Adaptations** are:
- They contain **haemoglobin** - a red protein that combines with oxygen
- They have *no nucleus* so they can contain more haemoglobin
- They are *small* and *flexible* so that they can fit through narrow blood vessels
- They have a **biconcave shape** (flattened disc shape) to maximise their surface area for oxygen absorption.
## White Blood Cells
White blood cells defend the body against disease
The majority of the white blood cells are a type of cell called **phagocytes**.
*More in [[Human Defence System]]*
## Platelets
They help to form scab and clot blood to prevent blood loss they do this by
- Releasing chemicals to form a mesh
- Sticking together to form clumps that get stuck in the mesh
## Plasma
- Transports carbon dioxide from respiring cells to the lungs
- Transports digested food from the small intestine to respiring cells
- Transports urea from the liver to the kidneys for excretion
- Distributes heat all around the body
- Transports hormones from the glands where they are made to the target organs
# Blood Vessels
There are 3 types of blood vessels: **Arteries**, **Veins**, **Capillaries** and they all have different functions and adaptations
## Arteries
- Carries blood *(Usually oxygenated except from the **pulmonary artery**)* away from heart to places it's needed in the body
- Thick elastic and muscular walls
- Narrow lumen
- Contain blood under **HIGH** pressure
## Veins
***More or less the opposite of arteries***
- Carries blood *(Usually **de-** oxygenated blood except from the **pulmonary vein**)* ***into*** the heart.
- Thin, less muscular walls
- Wide lumen
- Contain blood under **LOW** pressure
- *Has valves to prevent backflow of blood*
## Capillaries
Very different to veins and arteries. They are the **Site of gas and nutrients (from the blood) exchange**
- Found near every living cell
- Microscopic - walls are a single cell thick to allow easy diffusion into cells
- Very low blood pressure
## Table of Properties
||Artery|Vein|Capillary|
|---|---|---|---|
|Type of blood|Oxygenated|Deoxygenated|Both|
|Direction|Away from the heart|Towards the heart|From arteries to veins|
|Pressure|High|Low|Low|
|Size of hole (lumen)|Small|Large|Very small|
|Wall thickness|Thick|Thin|One cell thick|
|Valves|No|Yes|No|

# Coronary Heart Disease
This is a disease that is caused by blocked coronary arteries *(arteries that supply blood to the muscle of the heart)* usual blocked by **Fatty Plaques** containing cholesterol
## Symptoms
If a coronary artery is blocked, the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is cut off. That part of the heart cannot continue to contract, causing a **heart attack**.
## Treatments
| Treatment         | Description                                                                                       | Advantages                                                      | Disadvantages                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Statins           | A daily medication to control blood cholesterol levels                                            | Drugs reduce blood cholesterol levels                           | May cause side effects                                        |
| Angioplasty       | Surgery to insert a small balloon into a blood vessel which is then inflated to remove a blockage | Improved blood flow in coronary vessels preventing heart attack | Sometimes only a temporary measure                            |
| Lifestyle changes | Diet and exercise, stopping smoking etc                                                           | Reduces risk of heart disease and reduces blood pressure        | A high level of willpower is required to maintain the changes |

What are the 3 types of blood vessels and what are they roles and adaptations
?
- **Arteries**: 
	- Carries blood *(Usually oxygenated except from the **pulmonary artery**)* away from heart to places it's needed in the body, Thick elastic and muscular walls, Narrow lumen, Contain blood under **HIGH** pressure
- **Veins**: 
	- Carries blood *(Usually **de-** oxygenated blood except from the **pulmonary vein**)* ***into*** the heart., Thin, less muscular walls, Wide lumen, Contain blood under **LOW** pressure, *Has valves to prevent backflow of blood*
- **Capillaries**
	- They are the **Site of gas and nutrients (from the blood) exchange**, Found near every living cell, Microscopic - walls are a single cell thick to allow easy diffusion into cells, Very low blood pressure 

What are the 4 components of blood and what are they roles and adaptations
?
