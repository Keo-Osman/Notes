# Experiment
- First the scientists took a piece of very thin gold foil *(only a few atoms thick)*
- They then fired alpha particles at it *(which have a positive charge)*
- Most passed through with no change of direction
- Sometimes they were defected and changed direction other times they were reflected

# Results
- The fact that most passed through shows that atoms were mostly empty
- The deflection shows that the centre of the atom has a positive charge *(as like charges - positive alpha and positive nucleus - repel)*
- Because some straight back shows that centre of atom contains most of the mass in an atom
