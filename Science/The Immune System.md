- The immune system destroys pathogens and toxins
- It also protects against the same pathogen in the future

# White blood cells
- Can ingest and destroy pathogens by detecting chemicals release by pathogens and uses enzymes to destroy it - Phagocytosis
- *Certain types of white blood cells called **lymphocytes*** produce **antibodies** which are protein molecules, They stick to the pathogens which triggers the pathogen to be destroyed. Antibodies are specific
- Can produce **antitoxins** which stick to toxins to prevent them from damaging cells

How does the immune system work?
?
White blood cells can
- Can ingest and destroy pathogens by detecting chemicals release by pathogens and uses enzymes to destroy it - Phagocytosis
- Can produce **antibodies** which are protein molecules, They stick to the pathogens which triggers the pathogen to be destroyed. Antibodies are specific
- Can produce **antitoxins** which stick to toxins to prevent them from damaging cells

What is the role of the immune system?
?
- The immune system destroys pathogens and toxins
- It also protects against the same pathogen in the future
