# Transpiration
 It is the process of water evaporating from leaves.
 - Starts with evaporation of water from cells inside the leaf
 - Water vapour diffuses through air spaces  spongy mesophyll 
 - Exits out the stomata
 - Now water from xylem passes into leaf to replace water that's been lost
 - Finally water is drawn in from root hair cells up the xylem to leaf
