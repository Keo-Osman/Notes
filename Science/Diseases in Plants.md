# Plant Attack By Insects
- Plants can be attacked by insects such as aphids which extract nutrients from the plant stunting it's growth
# Diagnosing Plant Diseases
Look for:
- Discolouration
- Spots on leaves
- Stunted growth
- Decay
- Growths
- Malformed stems or leaves

# Identify Plant Diseases
 - Use garden manuals or websites
 - Take to a lab to identify pathogen
 - Us testing kits containing monoclonal antibodies

# Plant Ion deficiencies
## Nitrate
- Causes stunted growth
- Needed for protein synthesis
## Magnesium
- Causes chlorosis - discolouration
- Needed to make chlorophyll

# Specific Plant Diseases
##  Rose Black Spot
- **Type of pathogen**: **Fungus** (Diplocarpon rosae)
- **Symptoms**: Black or dark purple spots on the leaves of roses, leading to yellowing and premature leaf drop, weakening the plant.
- **Treatment**: Fungicides can be applied to prevent or treat infections. Removing and destroying affected leaves helps limit the spread.
- **How it spreads**: Through water droplets, especially when rain splashes the spores from the soil onto leaves. It can also spread through contaminated gardening tools.
## Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
- **Type of pathogen**: **Virus**
- **Symptoms**: Affects tobacco and other plants, causing mosaic-like patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, stunted growth, and reduced crop yield.
- **Treatment**: There is no cure for infected plants. Prevention involves planting resistant strains and maintaining proper hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and removing infected plants.
- **How it spreads**: The virus spreads through direct contact between infected plants, contaminated tools, hands, or soil.
