**Start of Method for ALL**
- First take the food sample and grind with distilled wate using a mortar and pestle to make a paste
- Transfer paste to beaker and add more distilled water  and stir so the chemicals in food dissolve in the water
- Filter solution to remove suspended food particles **EXCEPT WHEN TESTING FOR LIPIDS**

# Iodine Test for Starch
- Place 2cm$^3$ of food sample into a test tube
- Then add a few drops of iodine using pipette
- If starch is present the solution turns from brown to **Blue-Black**
# Benedict's Test for Reducing Sugars
 - Place 2cm$^3$ of food sample into a test tube
 - Add 10 drops of Benedict's solution
 - Place in a hot water bath
 - If reducing sugar is present a precipitate is formed and the solution will change colour. Colour tells you how much sugar there is:
	 - Green - low, Yellow - medium, Red - high
# Test for Protein
- Place 2cm$^3$ of food sample into a test tube
- Add 2cm$^3$ of blue biuret solution
- If protein is present to solution will change to a purple or lilac colour
# Test for Lipids
- DO NOT FILTER SOLUTION AFTER GRINDING IN MORTAR AND PESTLE
- Place 2cm$^3$ of food sample into a test tube
- Add a few drops of distilled water and ethanol
- Gently shake solution
- If lipids are present a white cloudy emulsion forms
