# Particle Types
## Coarse ($PM_{10}$)
Have a diameter between $1\times10^{-5}\text{m}$ and $2.5\times10^{-6}\text{m}$ and they contain many thousands of atoms
## Fine ($PM_{2.5}$)
Diameter between $2.5\times10^{-6}\text{m}$ and $1\times10^{-7}\text{m}$ contain several thousand atoms
## Nanoparticles
Diameter between$1\times10^{-7}\text{m}$ and $1\times10^{-9}\text{m}$ and contain only a few hundred atoms.
Has a huge *surface area : volume* ratio which is useful as you need a lot lower volume for the same effect.
Used in:
- Medicines
- Screams
- Cosmetics
- Deodorants
- Electronics
- Catalysts
**Risks:**
- Can be absorbed by body and enter cells, little is known about effects of this

**As particle size decreases by ten times the, *surface area : volume* ratio increases 10x**
