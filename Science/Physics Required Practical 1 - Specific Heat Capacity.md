# Method
- Place a beaker on balance and zero it
- Add oil and record mass of oil
- Then place an immersion heater and thermometer in the oil and record the starting temperature
- Wrap beaker in insulating foam
- Connect a joulemeter and a power pack to the immersion heater
- Leave for 30 mins and record temperature and energy transferred
- Calculate Specific Heat Capacity
*This practical could also be done with a 1kg steel block with a hole for the immersion heater - place water in hole with immersion heater to increase conductivity and transfer of energy*

# Sources of Inaccuracy
- Thermal energy passing out of the beaker into the air - Use an insulator with a lower thermal conductivity
- Not all thermal energy is transferred to oil - Ensure that it's fully submerged
- Incorrect reading of thermometer - use an electric probe
- Thermal energy not being spread through the oil - stir the oil

What are sources of inaccuracy and what are their solutions when investigating Specific Heat Capacity?
?
- Thermal energy passing out of the beaker into the air - Use an insulator with a lower thermal conductivity
- Not all thermal energy is transferred to oil - Ensure that it's fully submerged
- Incorrect reading of thermometer - use an electric probe
- Thermal energy not being spread through the oil - stir the oil
