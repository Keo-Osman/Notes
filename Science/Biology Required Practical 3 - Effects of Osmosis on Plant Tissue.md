# Method
- First peel potato skin
- Use a **cork borer** to produce 3 cylinders of the same diameter of potato
- Use a **scalpel** to trim the length to ~3cm
- Measure length and mass using ruler and balance
- Place each cylinder into a test tube and add 10cm$^3$ of 0.5M sugar solution to the first test tube, 0.25M to the second and distilled water to the third
-  Leave overnight to allow osmosis to take place
- Next remove potato cylinders and gently roll on paper towel to get rid of any surface moisture
- Finally measure length and mass of cylinders again

# Results

When the potato is in a low concentration solution the **concentration of sugar inside** is more than the outside so water moves in via osmosis but when it is less than outside water moves out via osmosis.

What is the method for investigating effects of osmosis on plat tissue?
?
- First peel potato skin
- Use a **cork borer** to produce 3 cylinders of the same diameter of potato

- Finally measure length and mass of cylinders again 

What is the result of osmosis practical with potatoes in various concentrations of sugar solution?
?
When the potato is in a low concentration solution the **concentration of sugar inside** is more than the outside so water moves in via osmosis but when it is less than outside water moves out via osmosis.
