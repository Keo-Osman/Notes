# Method
- First place a small beaker placed inside a larger beaker
- Then use a kettle to boil some water and transfer 80cm$^3$ into the small beaker
- Then use cardboard as a lid with a hole
- Place thermometer through hole
- Record starting temperature 
- Start a stopwatch
- Record temperature every 3 minutes for 15 minutes
- Repeat but use an insulating material to fill gap between beakers using same mass of material
*This practical could also be done with varying the amount of layers of insulation rather than the material*
