Energy is needed to break chemical bonds and it is released when bonds are made

# Exothermic
Exothermic reactions transfer energy from the reacting molecules to the surroundings, in other words releasing energy so temperature of the surroundings get hotter. 
Examples:
- Combustion
- Neutralisation
- *Some oxidation reactions*
Uses:
- Hand warmers
- Self-heating cans
# Endothermic
Exothermic reactions absorb energy into the reaction from the surroundings into reacting molecules, decreasing temperature of the surroundings
Examples:
- Thermal decomposition
Uses:
- Ice packs
