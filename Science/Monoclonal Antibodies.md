# How to Produce Monoclonal Antibodies
- First inject a mouse with an **antigen** then it's lymphocytes will produce antibodies against the antigen
- The collect lymphocytes from the mouse
- Fuse lymphocytes with a tumour cell this produces hybridoma cells which can produce antibodies and divide buy mitosis
- Then select a single hybridoma cell and allow it to clone via mitosis the cells formed are monoclonal antibodies
- Then collect the monoclonal antibodies and purify them

# Specificity
Monoclonal antibodies are specific to one binding site of one protein antigen as they are from from a single clone of hybridoma cells.
The benefit of this is that they can target a specific chemical or cell in the body.

# Uses 
## Pregnancy Test
Monoclonal antibodies are used to detect a specific hormone
## Lab Testing
Can use monoclonal antibodies to measure the levels of hormones in the blood
## Detect Pathogens
Can be used to test for specific pathogens
## Location
Monoclonal anti-bodies can be attached to dyes so when they attach to the specific antigen their location can be easily identified
## Treatment of Cancer
Make antibodies specific to cancer cells then attach radioactive substance or toxic drug to antibody. Then the monoclonal antibody attaches to cancer cell and the radioactive substance or toxic drug stop cancer cells from growing and dividing
