# Tissues in Leaves
The leaf is a plant organ that contains different tissues
![[Leaf Tissue Diagram.png]]
## Upper and Lower Epidermis
- Layer of very thin cells
- Protects surface of leaf
- Transparent to allow light to pass through
- Covered with waxy cuticle to reduce evaporation of water
## Stomata
-  Pores in lower epidermis which allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaf and oxygen to leave. 
- Also control water vapour
## Guard Cells
- On either side of stomata are and open and close stomata
## Palisade Mesophyll
- Contains lots of palisade cells which contain lots of chloroplast for photosynthesis
## Spongy Mesophyll
- Full of air spaces allow carbon dioxide to diffuse from stomata through spongy mesophyll to palisade cells, oxygen diffuses from palisade through spongy mesophyll to stomata
## [[Cells|Xylem]]
- Transports water from roots to the stem and leaves some of which is used in photo synthesise, transports dissolved mineral ions
## [[Cells|Phloem]]
- Transport dissolved sugars produced by photosynthesis from leaves to the rest of the plant
- Sugars are used in multiple ways

# Translocation
It's the movement of sugar and other molecules through phloem

# Meristem Tissue
- Found in growing tips
- Contains stem cells
