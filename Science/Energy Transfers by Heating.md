# Thermal Conductivity
The **thermal conductivity** of a material tells you how quickly energy is transmitted through thermal conduction. 
*You can test this by having materials of the same diameter and length and covering the end in wax and seeing how fast the wax melts*
# Insulating Buildings
Factors that affect rate of heat loss include:
- Thickness of walls and roof
- Thermal conductivity of walls and roof
You can reduce the thermal conductivity by using thermal insulators which have low thermal conductivity as there could be:
- Gaps of air which has low thermal conductivity
- Reflect infrared radiation

# Infrared Radiation
Infrared Radiation *(IFR)* is part of the EM spectrum. All objects emit and absorb IFR. The higher the temperature the more IFR an object emits in a given time.
If an objects temperature is constant then:
- IFR emitted = IFR absorbed
- IFR is emitted across a continuous range of wavelengths
An objects Temperature will increase if it absorbs IFR at a higher rate then it emits it.
### Black Body
A theoretical object that absorbs 100% of IFR that falls on it

# Radiation and Earth's Temperature
- The sun emits lots of radiation which heats Earth's surface
- Some is reflected by the earths surface
- Some of this then goes back into space
- However some of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which then re-emit IFR increasing Earth's Temperature
