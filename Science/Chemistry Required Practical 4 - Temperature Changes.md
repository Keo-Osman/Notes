# Method
*This is for a neutralisation reaction adding increasing volumes of alkali to the acid*
-  Using a measuring cylinder measure 30cm$^3$ of dilute acid and pour into a **polystyrene cup**
- Then stand he cup inside a beaker
- Use a thermometer to measure temperature of acid
- Measure 5cm$^3$ of alkali into cup with a measuring cylinder
- Then add a plastic lid on the cup to prevent unwanted energy transfers
- Place a thermometer through the lid making sure the bulb is in the solution
- Gently stir with thermometer
- When reading on thermometer stops increasing record the maximum temperature it reached
- Repeat with increasing volumes of alkali until you reach 40cm$^3$ 
- Repeat the whole experiment to obtain another set of results and calculate the mean value of maximum temperature reached for each volume of alkali
- Then plot a graph of results

# Results
The temperature will increase proportionally to the volume of alkali added until it reaches a maximum when everything reacts.
Then adding more alkali decreases the temperature as no more energy is released but it is spread out over a large volume

What are the results of a neutralisation reaction when adding increasing volumes of alkali?
?
The temperature will increase proportionally to the volume of alkali added until it reaches a maximum when everything reacts.
Then adding more alkali decreases the temperature as no more energy is released but it is spread out over a large volume
