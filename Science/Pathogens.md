Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease
# Types of Pathogens
## Bacteria
- Once inside the human body bacteria reproduce very rapidly
- It then releases harmful chemicals called toxins
- Toxins damage tissues and make us feel ill
## Viruses
- They can only reproduce inside a host cell
- First the virus invades th host cell
- It reproduces inside it
- This is damaging to the cell, when the virus leaves the cell it can cause the cell to burst open and die
## Protists
- Protists are a group of microorganisms that have features that belong to animals, plants and fungi
- Some are like animals, others more like plants and some, called moulds are closest to fungi. 
- They are all eukaryotic

## Fungi
- Not all fungi cause disease. 
- Not all fungi are single-celled. Some such as mushrooms are multicellular and so much larger. These are still made of tiny cells like yeast, but have many more of them.
- Fungal cells have a nucleus and so are eukaryotic
- Yeast is a single-celled fungus that is economically important because we use it to make some bread and beer.

# How Pathogens Spread
- Some are spread in airborne particles
- Some are spread in water 
- Some can be spread through direct contact between individuals
