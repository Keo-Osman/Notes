## Paper 1

### B1 - Cell Biology
#### Summary of Key Points
1. Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells: differences in structure and function.
2. Sub-cellular structures (nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, etc.) and their roles.
3. Cell differentiation and specialisation.
4. Microscopy: development from light to electron microscopes and calculation of magnification.
5. Mitosis and the cell cycle: growth and repair in organisms.
6. Stem cells: their uses in medicine and potential risks.
7. Diffusion, osmosis, and active transport processes in cells.
8. Required practicals on microscopy and osmosis.

### B2 - Organisation
#### Summary of Key Points
1. Principles of organisation: cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.
2. Human digestive system: enzymes and their role in digestion.
3. The heart, blood vessels, and double circulatory system.
4. Blood components and their functions (e.g. red blood cells, white blood cells).
5. Coronary heart disease and treatments (e.g. stents, statins).
6. Health issues: causes of disease (e.g. poor diet, smoking, alcohol).
7. Risk factors for non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases).
8. Transport in plants: xylem and phloem, transpiration, and translocation.

### B3 - Infection and Response
#### Summary of Key Points
1. Pathogens: bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists.
2. Human defence systems against disease: skin, white blood cells, antibodies.
3. Viral, bacterial, fungal, and protist diseases (e.g. measles, HIV, salmonella, malaria).
4. Vaccination: how vaccines prevent disease and reduce pathogen spread.
5. Antibiotics and painkillers: treatment of bacterial diseases and issues of resistance.
6. Discovery and development of new drugs (clinical trials and testing).
7. Monoclonal antibodies: uses in diagnosis, treatment, and ethical concerns.
8. Plant diseases and defence mechanisms.

### B4 - Bioenergetics
#### Summary of Key Points
1. Photosynthesis: process, word equation, and factors affecting the rate.
2. Uses of glucose in plants: respiration, storage as starch, and protein synthesis.
3. Aerobic and anaerobic respiration in cells.
4. Fermentation in yeast cells: its role in baking and brewing.
5. Response to exercise: increased breathing and heart rate, oxygen debt, and muscle fatigue.
6. Metabolism: the sum of all chemical reactions in an organism.

## Paper 2

### B5 - Homeostasis and Response
#### Summary of Key Points
1. Homeostasis: the regulation of internal conditions (e.g. temperature, water, glucose levels).
2. The nervous system: receptors, sensory neurons, the brain, and spinal cord.
3. Reflex actions: rapid responses to stimuli.
4. The endocrine system: hormones and glands (e.g. insulin, adrenaline).
5. Controlling blood glucose levels: insulin, glucagon, and diabetes.
6. Human reproductive hormones: puberty, menstrual cycle, fertility treatments.
7. Required practical on reaction times.
