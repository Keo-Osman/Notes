# Bacterial Division
- Bacteria multiply by simple cell division
- One bacterial cell splits onto two this is called binary fission
- Bacteria can doo this about once every 20 minutes as long as they have enough nutrients and the temperature is suitable

# Mitosis
![[Mitosis.png|400]]
**The Process:**
- First the [[DNA]] replicates to form 2 copies of each chromosome and the cell grows and copies internal structures
- Then the nuclear membrane breaks down and the chromosomes line up across the centre of the cell
- One set of chromosomes is pulled to each end and split
- The cytoplasm and cell membranes divide to form 2 **identical daughter cells**
