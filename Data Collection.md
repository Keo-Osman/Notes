# Population & Samples
- Population: A set of objects that are of interest
- Census: An observation/measurement of every member of a population
- Sample: A selection of observations/measurements of a subset of a population which is used to estimate information about the whole population
- Sampling Units: Individual units of a population
- Sampling Frame: Sampling units that are individually named/numbered to form a list
# Sampling Methods
- Simple Random Sampling: Every member of the population has equal chance of being selected
- Systematic Sampling: Required elements are chosen at regular intervals from an ordered list
- Stratified Sampling: The population is divided into mutually exclusive strata and a random sample is taken for each. The size of strata is proportional to its size compared to the whole population
- Quota Sampling: An interviewer selects a sample that reflects the characteristics of the whole population
- Opportunity/Convenience Sampling: Taking a sample from people who are available at the time and fit your given criteria
