# Method
- First set up a series circuit with a battery, variable resistor, an ammeter and a voltmeter in parallel across the component you're testing
- Record the potential difference and current in a table
- Now adjust the variable resistor and take readings again
- repeat this several times to get a range of readings
- Reverse the terminals on the battery and repeat experiment again
- Plot a graph of the current against potential difference
