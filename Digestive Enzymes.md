Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions and are **large protein molecules** and they have a groove on their surface called the **active site** where the **substrate** attaches to.

# Molecules Broken Down
## Proteins/Protease
- Proteins are broken down by **protease** 
- Protease is found in the **stomach, pancreas and small intestine** 
- Proteins are broken down into their individual amino acids 
- Amino acids are absorbed into bloodstream then they are then joined in a different order to make human proteins 
## Carbohydrates/Carbohydrase & Starch/Amylase
- Carbohydrates are broken down Carbohydrases in the specific case of starch it's broken down by amylase
- Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars
- **Amylase** is found in the saliva and pancreatic fluid
## Lipids/Lipase
- Lipids are broken down by lipase into fatty acids and glycerol
- Lipase is found int the pancreatic fluid and small intestine

# Bile
- Bile is made in the liver and is stored in the gall bladder.
- It helps to speed up digestion of **lipids** but it is **NOT** and enzyme
- It converts large lipid droplets into smaller ones - this is called **emulsifying** the lipid
- It's an alkaline that neutralises stomach acid
