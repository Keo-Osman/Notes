# Method
-  First start with a fixed volume of dilute acid *(acid depends on what your making will usually be sulfuric). **This is the limiting reactant***
-  Gently heat using a bunsen burner until it's almost boiling
- The using a spatula slowly add **Metal/Metal Oxide/Metal Carbonate** to the acid and stir with glass rod - add in excess so all acid reacts
- Then filter the solution with a filter paper and funnel into an evaporating basin
- Heat gently over a beaker of boiling water until half the solution remains
- Leave solution in a cool place for 24h for crystals to form
- Then get rid of any possible acid on the surface by using a paper towel
