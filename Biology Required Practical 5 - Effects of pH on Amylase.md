# Method
- First, on a tile, add a drop of iodine solution to each well
- Add 2cm$^3$ of a pH buffer solution into a test tube
- Fill another test tube with starch solution and another will amylase
- Then place all 3 test tubes into a water bath at 25$\degree$C and wait a few minutes for them to reach this temperature.
- Then add the amylase into the test tube buffer and then the starch into the same test tube and start timing immediately
- Then add a drop of the solution onto the a well of the tile
- Repeat every 30 seconds until solution doesn't turn blue-black
- Calculate rate of reaction
- Repeat with different pH valued buffers
