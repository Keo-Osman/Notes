## Weimar Constitution
- President who was head of state
- President chose a chancellor who chose the ministers who made up the cabinet
- *"Parliament"* made of two houses, the **Reichstag** *(More powerful, Controlled taxation and directly elected by people at least once every 4 years)* and **Reichsrat** *Each region of Germany sent a number of representatives depending on their size)*

- Army was restricted to 100,000 men
- Rhineland *(bordered Germany and France)* was to be demilitarised.
- Germany lost a lot of it's own land
## Challenges to Weimar Government
- Germans felt stabbed in the back by politicians signing the Treaty of Versailles as propaganda said that they were winning the war
- **Spartacist Revolt**
	- Lead by Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht
	- Left wing
	- Took advantage of strikes and protests in Berlin. 100,000 workers went on strike in support of the Spartacists
	- Ebert used the Reichswehr *(army)* to organise demobilised soldiers into Freikorps units and stop the revolt
	- Both leaders were captured and killed
- **Kapp Putsch**
	- Lead by Wolfgang Kapp
	- Right wing
	- Freikorps in Berlin were going to be disbanded
	- In fear of being unemployed from this, 5000 men marched into Berlin armed and declared a new government and invited the kaiser to return
	- Ebert sent Reichswehr to stop but they refused and many joined
	- Workers went on strike and vital services went down forcing Kapp to surrender
- Extreme parties getting more popular mostly **right wing**
## Hyperinflation
- **How it happened:**
	- Treaty of Versailles *(ToV)* signed
	- Germany had to pay £50m per year which it could not do
	- ToV allowed allies to take what Germany owed them
	- December 1922 Germany couldn't pay
	- French had to pay war debts to Americans so they were desperate for money
	- January 1923 French troops entered the Ruhr and seized all coal and machinery
	- Ebert encouraged coal workers to go on strike/passive resistance
	- With no coal factories were not producing goods so the government was receiving less in taxes
	- All of Germany's gold reserves were used during the war. Germany was bankrupt
	- To solve problem of inflation Germany tried to print more money but this lead to more inflation. **Hyperinflation**
- **Effects**
	- Money Worthless

	- People turned to bartering
	- Affected political parties

## Great Depression and Wall Street Crash

## How Hitler Became a Dictator
- **Enabling Act** allowed Hitler to come closer to total power
- **How it happened:**
	- Hitler became chancellor but his power was limited
	- He called for an election in for March 1933
	- Reichstag fire by communist led to arrest of 4000 communists
	- Hitler convinced Hindenburg to pass an act using article 48 to allow Nazis to imprison large amounts of people including political opponents
	- March 1933 election: Reichstag fire blamed on communists made them lose votes so after forming a coalition with DNVP the Nazis had a 51.9% majority
	- Hitler passed the enabling act which would allow him to pass laws without the Reichstag for 4 years 88% of Reichstag voted for it.
	- However, Hitler got SA to surround voting chamber to pressure into voting yes and no communists were allowed in
	- Banned Trade unions
	- Made all other parties in Germany illegal
	- Holds an election with Nazi party being only party they gained tons of votes
